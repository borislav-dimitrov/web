          The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an open world action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series, following 2006's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on November 11, 2011.

          The game's main story revolves around the player's character, the Dragonborn, on their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The game is set 200 years after the events of Oblivion and takes place in Skyrim, the northernmost province of Tamriel. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. The game continues the open-world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.
          
          Skyrim was developed using the Creation Engine, rebuilt specifically for the game. The team opted for a unique and more diverse open world than Oblivion's Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, which game director and executive producer Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison. The game was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers particularly mentioning the character advancement and setting, and is considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time. Nonetheless it received some criticism, predominantly for its melee combat and numerous technical issues present at launch. The game shipped over seven million copies to retailers within the first week of its release, and over 30 million copies on all platforms as of November 2016, making it one of the best selling video games in history.
          
          Three downloadable content (DLC) add-ons were released separately — Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn, which were bundled along with the base game into The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Legendary Edition and released in June 2013.
          
          A remastered version, titled The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Special Edition was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in October 2016. It includes all three DLC expansions and a graphical upgrade, along with additional features such as modding capabilities on consoles.
          
          A port for the Nintendo Switch, based partly on the remastered version and titled simply The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, was released on November 2017. However the Switch version's graphics upgrade was relative to its hardware capabilities and it did not include the modding features.
          
          A separate VR-only version, titled The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR, was released in November 2017 for the PlayStation 4 using PlayStation VR, and for Windows-based VR headsets in April 2018. This version also contains certain improvements from the Special Edition such as an updated engine and all released downloadable content.
