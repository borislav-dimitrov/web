          Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a compilation of the video games in the Mass Effect trilogy: Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 3. It was developed by BioWare with assistance from Abstraction Games and Blind Squirrel Games, and published by Electronic Arts. All three games were remastered, with visual enhancements, technical improvements, and gameplay adjustments. Mass Effect, the first game of the trilogy, has received more extensive upgrades than its counterparts, specifically with regard to combat mechanics, vehicle handling, and loading times.

          Development on Legendary Edition commenced in 2019 under the direction of Mac Walters. Although BioWare initially considered other alternatives, they ultimately decided to approach the project as a remaster as opposed to a remake in order to preserve the original trilogy experience. The compilation was announced on November 7, 2020, and was released on May 14, 2021 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. The compilation received acclaim for its updated visuals and technical improvements.
